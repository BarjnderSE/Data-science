### Key Definitions in CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts the input image data as a 2D or 3D array (height, width, channels).  
2. **Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**: Applies filters (kernels) to the input to detect local patterns like edges, textures, or shapes.  
3. **Filters (Kernels)**: Small matrices that slide over the input to perform feature extraction by convolution.  
4. **Stride**: Defines the step size of the filter when moving across the input.  
5. **Padding**: Adds extra pixels around the input to preserve dimensions after convolution (e.g., "same" or "valid").  
6. **Activation Function (ReLU)**: Introduces non-linearity to the model by replacing negative values with zero.  
7. **Pooling Layer (MaxPooling2D)**: Reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) while retaining important features, e.g., max or average pooling.  
8. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the multi-dimensional feature maps into a 1D vector for the fully connected layer.  
9. **Fully Connected Layer (Dense)**: Processes flattened data to predict output classes or values.  
10. **Dropout Layer**: Randomly disables neurons during training to prevent overfitting.  
11. **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes intermediate layers to stabilize learning and improve performance.  
12. **Softmax Activation**: Converts raw output scores into probabilities for multi-class classification.  
13. **Loss Function (e.g., Cross-Entropy)**: Measures the error between predicted and true labels to guide learning.  
14. **Optimizer (e.g., Adam)**: Updates model weights during backpropagation to minimize the loss function.  
15. **Epoch**: One complete pass of the entire training dataset through the network.  
16. **Batch Size**: Number of training samples processed before updating the model weights.  
17. **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size of weight updates during training.  
18. **Weight Initialization**: Sets the initial values of the model weights to start the learning process.  
19. **Backpropagation**: Algorithm to compute gradients for updating weights using the chain rule.  
20. **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm to minimize the loss by adjusting weights based on gradients.  
21. **Feature Maps**: The output of convolutional layers, representing extracted features of the input image.  
22. **Kernel Size**: Dimensions of the filter matrix used in convolution (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).  
23. **Receptive Field**: The region of the input image that influences a particular feature in the output.  
24. **Epoch vs Iteration**: Epoch is one full dataset pass, while iteration is one batch processing step within an epoch.  
25. **Validation Set**: Data used to evaluate the model during training but not used for weight updates.  
26. **Test Set**: Data used to assess the final model's performance after training.  
27. **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.  
28. **Regularization (e.g., L2, Dropout)**: Techniques to reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights or adding noise.  
29. **Gradient Vanishing/Exploding**: Challenges in training due to gradients becoming too small or too large during backpropagation.  
30. **Pre-trained Models**: CNNs trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) used for transfer learning.
